# area of round 

hard problem -> sum of many small values -> **Area under a graph**

Many of these types of problems turn out be to equivalent to finding the area under some graph.

 - What's the are underneath that curve , say between the values of x=0 and x=3 ? 
 - Let's reframe this question in a slightly different way:
    - we'll fix that left endpoint in place at 0, and let the right endpoint vary.
    - Are you able to find a function A(x) that gives you the area under x² between 0 and x?
 - A function `A(x)` like this is called an integral of x².
 - Calculus holds withit it the tools to figure out what an integral like this is.

**Representation**

- In practice. Use adjacency-lists representation.
    - Algorithms based on iterating over vertices pointing from v.

## Depth-first search

- Typical applications
    - Find all vertices connected to a given source vertex
    - Find a path between two vertices
- Goal. Find all vertices connected to s (and a corresponding path).

```
pseudo cod
To visit a vertex v :
    - Mark vertex v as visited.
    - Recursively visit all unmarked vertices adjacent to v.
```

- Data structures
    - `boolean[] marked` to mark visited vertices
    - `int[] edgeTo`  to keep tree of paths
        - (edgeTo[w] == v) means that edge v-w taken to visit w for first time
 
```java
// it is actually the `explore` method
// it explores node in a connected components
private void dfs(Graph G, int v)
{
    marked[v] = true;
    for (int w : G.adj(v))
        if (!marked[w])
        {
            dfs(G, w);
            edgeTo[w] = v;
        }
} 
```

![](../imgs/graphSearch_dfs.png)

- Proposition
    - DFS marks all vertices connected to *s* in time proportional to the sum of their degrees.
    - After DFS, can find vertices connected to *s* in constant time and can find a path to *s* (if one exists) in time proportional to its length.

```java
pubilc boolean hasPathTo(int v)
{  
    return marked[v];  
}
public Iterable<Integer> pathTo(int v)
{
    if (!hasPathTo(v)) return null;
    Stack<Integer> path = new Stack<Integer>();
    // find path node excludes source node
    for (int x = v; x != s; x = edgeTo[x])
        path.push(x);
    // add the source node to complete the path
    path.push(s);
    return path;
}
```

<h2 id="9f5783932f655ffe3908ff7d3410497e"></h2>

## Breadth-first search

```
// pseudo code
BFS (from source vertex s)
    
Put s onto a FIFO queue, and mark s as visited.
Repeat until the queue is empty:
    remove the least recently added vertex v
    add each of v's unvisited neighbors to the queue
    and mark them as visited
```

- replace `queue` with stack ,and this algorithm can work as DFS.

- Proposition
    - BFS computes shortest paths (fewest number of edges) from *s* to all other vertices in a graph in time proportional to E + V.

---

```java
private void bfs(Graph G, int s)
{
    Queue<Integer> q = new Queue<Integer>();
    q.enqueue(s);
    marked[s] = true;
    while (!q.isEmpty())
    {
        int v = q.dequeue();
        for (int w : G.adj(v))
        {
            if (!marked[w])
            {
                q.enqueue(w);
                marked[w] = true;
                edgeTo[w] = v;
            }
        } // end for
    } // end while
} // end bfs
```

## connected components

- GOAL: Preprocess graph to answer queries of the form is v connected to w?  in constant time.
    - Union-Find? Not quite.
    - Depth-first search. Yes. 
- Goal: Partition vertices into connected components.

```
// pseudo code
Connected components

initialize all vertices v as unmarked.
For each unmarked vertex v, run DFS to identify all
vertices discovered as part of the same component.
```

```java
private boolean[] marked;
// id[v] = (index or ID of component)
private int[] id; 
// record component index
private int count; 

public CC(Graph G) {
    marked = new boolean[G.V()];
    id = new int[G.V()];
    for (int v = 0; v < G.V(); v++) {
        if (!marked[v])
        {
            // run DFS from one vertex
            // in each component
            dfs(G, v);
            count++; 
        } // end if
    } // end for
} // end CC

private void dfs(Graph G, int v)
{
    marked[v] = true;
    // all vertices discovered in same 
    // call of dfs have same id
    id[v] = count ;
    for (int w : G.adj(v))
        if (!marked[w])
            dfs(G, w);

### Topological sort

- **DAG**. Directed acyclic graph.
- **Topological sort**. Redraw DAG so all edges point upwards.
- ![](../imgs/algorII_graph_topo_sort.png)
- Solution. DFS. 
    - What else solutions ?  might be hard to find a different way
    - just run DFS
    - but there's a particular point at which we want to take the vertices out to get the roder , and
        - what we do is when we do the DFS, when we're done with the vertex ( `done` means that vertex has no out-degree ), we put it on a stack or put it out.
            - 有 out-degree ，但是连接的 vertex 已经访问过，也算 `done`
            - then trace back to vertex 1 

    - that's called reverse DFS postorder.
    - ![](../imgs/algorII_graph_topo_sort_illu.png)

```java
public class DepthFirstOrder {
    private boolean[] marked;
    private Stack<Integer> reversePost; // 1

    public DepthFirstOrder(Digraph G) {
        reversePost = new Stack<Integer>(); //2
        marked = new boolean[G.V()];
        for (int v = 0; v < G.V(); v++)
            if (!marked[v]) explore(G, v);
    }

    private void explore(Digraph G, int v) {
        marked[v] = true;
        for (int w : G.adj(v))
            if (!marked[w]) explore(G, w);
        reversePost.push(v);  // 3
    }

    // 4      
    public Iterable<Integer> reversePost() {  
        ArrayList<Integer> l = new ArrayList<Integer>() ;
        while ( reversePost.size()>0 ) {
            l.add(  reversePost.pop()  ) ;   
        }
        return l ;
    }
}
```

- **Proposition**. Reverse DFS postorder of a DAG is a topological order.
- Running Time : O(m+n)


<h2 id="71fb8dfa2678cc85259174067fbb7bb2"></h2>

### Directed cycle detection

- **Proposition**. A digraph has a topological order iff no directed cycle.
- Pf.
    - If directed cycle,  topological order impossible.
    - If no directed cycle, DFS-based algorithm finds a topological order.

## strong components

<h2 id="d0a679dff20875ea17dcf0679ddd9ae9"></h2>

### Strongly-connected components
 
- Def. Vertices v and w are **strongly connected** if there is both a directed path from v to w and a directed path from w to v.
- Key property. Strong connectivity is an **equivalence relation**:
    - v is strongly connected to v
    - If v is strongly connected to w, then w is strongly connected to v.
    - If v is strongly connected to w and w to x, then v is strongly connected to x.
- Def. A **strong component** is a maximal subset of strongly-connected vertices.
    - ![](../imgs/algorII_graph_strong_component.png)
- 强连通图必然有环
    - so if a graph has no directed cycle, the number of SCC must equal to the number of vertices
- Strong component application: software modules
    - Vertex = software module.
    - Edge: from module to dependency.
    - Strong component. Subset of mutually interacting modules.
    - Approach 1. Package strong components together.
    - Approach 2. Use to improve design!
    
![](../imgs/SCC.PNG)

- 如上图，如果我们从 最右侧的SCC 中的任意一个 node开始查找, DFS可以找到这3个nodes 组成的SCC; 但是 如果最下面的 node开始查找, DFS会找到下方和右方两个SCC的集合; 如果我们直接从最左边的 node 开始查找，则DFS会找到整个graph.
- 可以看到，从不同的node开始DFS, 会得到不同的结果. 所以，在应用DFS之前，我们需要一步预处理: 我们需要一个正确的 node 访问顺序。

### Kosaraju-Sharir algorithm: intuition

    - Compute topological order (reverse postorder) in kernel DAG.  (how to ?)
    - Run DFS, considering vertices in reverse topological order.

> kernel DAG of G (in reverse topological order)

<h2 id="9844834019d43e5059b822f482b610df"></h2>

### Kosaraju-Sharir algorithm

- Phase 1. run DFS on Gᴿ to compute reverse postorder .
    - 确定 phase 2 DFS 的vertex 访问顺序
- Phase 2. run DFS on G, considering vertices in order given by first DFS
    - 注意，这里我们恢复到 原图G了，我们在 原图G上执行DFS
    - it is really same as to compute CC.

```java
private boolean[] marked;
// id[v] = (index or ID of component)
private int[] id; 
// record component index
private int count; 

public SCC(Digraph G) {
    marked = new boolean[G.V()];
    id = new int[G.V()];
    // +
    DepthFirstOrder dfs = new DepthFirstOrder(G.reverse());
    // m 
    for (int v : dfs.reversePost())
    //for (int v = 0; v < G.V(); v++) 
    {
        if (!marked[v])
        {
            // run DFS from one vertex
            // in each component
            dfs(G, v);
            count++; 
        } // end if
    } // end for
} // end CC

private void dfs(Digraph G, int v)
{
    marked[v] = true;
    // all vertices discovered in same 
    // call of dfs have same id
    id[v] = count ;
    for (int w : G.adj(v))
        if (!marked[w])
            dfs(G, w);
}
```


- Compare to compute CC , there is only 2 lines different.
- PS. The DFS in the 1st phase (  to compute reverse postorder ) is crucial;  in the 2nd phase , any algorithm that marks the set of vertices reachable from a given vertex will do.  Since Strong components in G are same as in Gᴿ , you also can run DFS on Gᴿ then run DFS on G which will get the same result.

---

- Simple (but mysterious) algorithm for computing strong components.
- Proposition. Kosaraju-Sharir algorithm computes the strong components of a digraph in time proportional to E + V.
- Pf.
    - Running time: bottleneck is running DFS twice (and computing Gᴿ).
    - Implementation: easy!

    - A: run BFS from each vertex.
- Hamiltonian path in a DAG
    - Given a directed acyclic graph, design a linear-time algorithm to determine whether it has a Hamiltonian path (a simple path that visits every vertex), and if so, find one.
    - A: topological sort  ( DAG 经过一个vertex 就回不去了 )
- Reachable vertex
    - DAG: Design a linear-time algorithm to determine whether a DAG has a vertex that is reachable from every other vertex, and if so, find one.
        - A: compute the outdegree of each vertex.
    - Digraph: Design a linear-time algorithm to determine whether a digraph has a vertex that is reachable from every other vertex, and if so, find one.
        - A: compute the strong components and look at the kernel DAG . Then it leads to the previous DAG problem.

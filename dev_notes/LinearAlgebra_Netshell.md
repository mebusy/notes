# linear Algebra in a Nutshell

A is n by n.

 Nonsingular |  Singular
 :--- |:---
A is invertible. | A is not invertible. 
The columns are independent. | The columns are dependent.
The rows are independent. | The rows are dependent.
The determinant is not zero. | The determinant is zero.
Ax = 0 has one solution x = 0. | Ax = 0 has infinitely many solutions.
Ax = b has one solution x = A⁻¹b. | Ax = b has no solution or infinitely many.
A has n (nonzero) pivots. | A has r < n pivots.
A has full rank r = n. | A has rank r < n.
The reduced row echelon form is R = I. | R has at least one zero row.
The column space is all of Rⁿ. | The column space has dimension r < n. 
The row space is all  of Rⁿ. | The row space has dimension r < n.
All eigenvalues are nonzero. | Zero is an eigenvalue of A.
AᵀA is symmetric positive definite. | AᵀA is only semidefinite.
A has n (positive) singular values. | A has r < n singular values.


    Each line of the singular column can be made quantitative using row.

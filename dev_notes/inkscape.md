## Text and Fonts

- modify positions of some specific characters in a text
    - selet those characters ( line wise by default ) , then hold Alt key  + arrow keys
- more tools
    - menu/Extensions/Text/
        - capitalize, lowercase, uppercase, split ...
    - menu/Text/Put on Path
        - then menu/Path/Object to path , to finalize it. ( you now can remove the object used to path )
    - how to put the text on the path inside a circle  ?
        - Put on Path
        - flip horizontally
        - but the letters are too close, choose the text tool, set the letter space.

## Drawing Lines and Paths vs Objects

- FreeHand Drawing tool creates path, while tools like rectange, circle creating objects.
- Draw Line
    - Recommended way is to use `Bezier Curve Tools`
- We can convert a object to a path
    - menu/Path/Object to Path
    - We can also add node to path, by double clicking on the path (edge).

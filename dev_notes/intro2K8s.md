## HTTP API Space of Kubernetes

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mebusy/notes/master/imgs/k8s-api-server-space.jpg)

HTTP API space of Kubernetes can be divided into three independent groups:

 - Core Group (/api/v1)
    - This group includes objects such as Pods, Services, nodes, etc.
 - Named Group
    - This group includes objects in **/apis/$NAME/$VERSION** format
    - These different API versions imply different levels of stability and support:
        - Alpha level - it may be dropped at any point in time, without notice. For example, /apis/batch/v2alpha1.
        - Beta level - it is well-tested, but the semantics of objects may change in incompatible ways in a subsequent beta or stable release. 
            - example, /apis/certificates.k8s.io/v1beta1
        - Stable level - appears in released software for many subsequent versions.
            - For example, /apis/networking.k8s.io/v1
 - System-wide
    - This group consists of system-wide API endpoints, like /healthz, /logs, /metrics, /ui, etc.

<h2 id="70becb84ec118d75e27f125448562a2b"></h2>

## kubectl Configuration File

 - To connect to the Kubernetes cluster, kubectl needs the master node endpoint and the credentials to connect to it.
 - On the master node machine, by default, a configuration file, config, inside the.kube directory, which resides in the user's home directory.
 - That configuration file has all the connection details.  
 - To look at the connection details, we can either see the content of the ~/.kube/config(Linux) file, or run the following command:


```
# kubectl config view
apiVersion: v1
clusters:
- cluster:
    certificate-authority-data: DATA+OMITTED
    server: https://10.192.83.78:6443
  name: kubernetes
...
```

 - Once kubectl is installed, we can get information about the Minikube cluster with the `kubectl cluster-info` command

```
# kubectl cluster-info
```


<h2 id="6bbde18895b093a1a0fc79b5c02e4462"></h2>

## Kubernetes dashboard 

<h2 id="ae1fd03692378014b99c5c70b6c121af"></h2>

### Deploying the Dashboard UI

```
kubectl create -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kubernetes/dashboard/master/src/deploy/recommended/kubernetes-dashboard.yaml
```

<h2 id="f32d0f539f9fbaff4c670cd2e5d7b14d"></h2>

### Accessing the Dashboard UI

```
kubectl proxy
```

 - Kubectl will make Dashboard available at
    - `http://localhost:8001/api/v1/namespaces/kube-system/services/https:kubernetes-dashboard:/proxy/`

<h2 id="d7dba71d2e1aa5aea658e819489eab4d"></h2>

### APIs - with 'kubectl proxy'

 - When kubectl proxy is configured, we can send requests to localhost on the proxy port:
    - With the above curl request, we requested all the API endpoints from the API server.

```
$ curl http://localhost:8001/
{
 "paths": [
   "/api",
   "/api/v1",
   "/apis",
   "/apis/apps",
   ......
   ......
   "/logs",
   "/metrics",
   "/swaggerapi/",
   "/ui/",
   "/version"
 ]
}
```

<h2 id="c4a8eba76a7943e2e98a2e8b0f014db3"></h2>

### APIs - without 'kubectl proxy'

 - Without **kubectl proxy** configured, we can get the **Bearer Token** using kubectl,and then send it with the API request.
 - A **Bearer Token** is an **access token** which is generated by the authentication server(the API server on the master node) and given back to the client. 
 - Using that token, the client can connect back to the Kubernetes API server without providing further authentication details, and then, access resources. 

 - **Get the token**

```
TOKEN=$(kubectl describe secret -n kube-system $(kubectl get secrets -n kube-system | grep default | cut -f1 -d ' ') | grep -E '^token' | cut -f2 -d':' | tr -d '\t' | tr -d " ")
```

 - **Get the API server endpoint**


```
APISERVER=$(kubectl config view | grep https | cut -f 2- -d ":" | tr -d " ")
# echo $APISERVER
https://10.192.83.78:6443
```

 - Access the API Server using the curl command, as shown below

```
curl $APISERVER/api --header "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" --insecure
{
  "kind": "APIVersions",
  "versions": [
    "v1"
  ],
  "serverAddressByClientCIDRs": [
    {
      "clientCIDR": "0.0.0.0/0",
      "serverAddress": "10.192.83.78:6443"
    }
  ]
}
```

# Kubernetes Building Blocks

## Kubernetes Object Model

 - With each object, we declare our intent or desired state using the **spec** field
 - The Kubernetes system manages the **status** field for objects, in which it records the actual state of the object. 
 - To create an object, we need to provide the **spec** field to the Kubernetes API server. 
    - The spec field describes the desired state, along with some basic information, like the name. 
 - Below is an example of a Deployment object:

```
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: nginx-deployment
  labels:
    app: nginx
spec:
  replicas: 3
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: nginx
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: nginx
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: nginx
        image: nginx:1.7.9
        ports:
        - containerPort: 80
```

 - kind
    - mention the object type
 - metadata
    - attach the basic information to objects, like the name.
 - spec
    - define the desired state of the deployment.
    - You may have noticed that in our example we have two spec fields (spec and spec.template.spec).
    - In our example, we want to make sure that, at any point in time, at least 3 Pods are running, which are created using the Pods Template defined in spec.template.
    - In spec.template.spec, we define the desired state of the Pod.
        - Here, our Pod would be created using nginx:1.7.9.
 - Once the object is created, the Kubernetes system attaches the **status** field to the object; we will explore it later.

## Pods

 - A Pod is the smallest and simplest Kubernetes object.
    - It is the unit of deployment in Kubernetes, which represents a single instance of the application. 
 - A Pod is a logical collection of one or more containers, which:
    - Are scheduled together on the same host
    - Share the same network namespace
    - Mount the same external storage (volumes).

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mebusy/notes/master/imgs/k8s_pod.png)

 - Pods do not have the capability to self-heal by themselves. 
    - That is why we use them with controllers, which can handle a Pod's replication, fault tolerance, self-heal, etc. 
    - Examples of controllers are Deployments, ReplicaSets, ReplicationControllers, etc.
 - We attach the Pod's specification to other objects using Pods Templates, as we have seen in the previous section.


## Labels

 - Labels are key-value pairs that can be attached to any Kubernetes objects (e.g. Pods).
 - Labels are used to organize and select a subset of objects, based on the requirements in place.
 - Many objects can have the same Label(s). Labels do not provide uniqueness to objects.  

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mebusy/notes/master/imgs/k8s_label.png)

 - In the image above, we have used two Labels: app and env.
    - Based on our requirements, we have given different values to our four Pods.

## Label Selectors

 - With Label Selectors, we can select a subset of objects. 
 - Kubernetes supports two types of Selectors:
    - Equality-Based Selectors
        - allow filtering of objects based on Label keys and values. 
        - With this type of selectors, we can use the =, ==, or != operators. 
        - For example, with env==dev we are selecting the objects where the env Label is set to dev. 
    - Set-Based Selectors
        - allow filtering of objects based on a set of values
        - With this type of Selectors, we can use the in, notin, and exist operators. 
        - For example, with **env in (dev,qa)**, we are selecting objects where the env Label is set to dev or qa. 

## ReplicationControllers

 - A ReplicationController (rc) is a controller that is part of the master node's controller manager. 
 - It makes sure the specified number of replicas for a Pod is running at any given point in time.
 - Generally, we don't deploy a Pod independently, as it would not be able to re-start itself, if something goes wrong. 
 - We always use controllers like ReplicationController to create and manage Pods. 

## ReplicaSets

 - A ReplicaSet (rs) is the next-generation ReplicationController.
 - ReplicaSets support both equality- and set-based selectors, whereas ReplicationControllers only support equality-based Selectors.
    - Currently, this is the only difference.

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mebusy/notes/master/imgs/k8s_rs.png)

 - ReplicaSets can be used independently, but they are mostly used by Deployments to orchestrate the Pod creation, deletion, and updates. 
 - A Deployment automatically creates the ReplicaSets, and we do not have to worry about managing them. 


## Deployments

 - Deployment objects provide declarative updates to Pods and ReplicaSets.
 - The DeploymentController is part of the master node's controller manager, and it makes sure that the current state always matches the desired state.
 - let's say we have a **Deployment** which creates a **ReplicaSet A**.  **ReplicaSet A** then create **3 Pods**. 
    - In each Pod, one of the containers user the nginx:1.7.9 image.
 - Now, in the Deployment, we change the Pods Template and we update the image for the nginx container from nginx:1.7.9 to nginx:1.9.1.
    - As have modified the Pods Template, a new **ReplicaSet B** gets created. 
    - This process is referred to as a **Deployment rollout**.
 - A rollout is only triggered when we update the Pods Template for a deployment.
    - Operations like scaling the deployment do not trigger the deployment.
 - Once **ReplicaSet B** is ready, the Deployment starts pointing to it.
 - Once ReplicaSet B is ready, the Deployment starts pointing to it,
    - with which, if something goes wrong, we can rollback to a previously known state.

## Namespaces

 - we can partition the Kubernetes cluster into sub-clusters using Namespaces.
 - The names of the resources/objects created inside a Namespace are unique, but not across Namespaces.

```
# kubectl get namespaces
NAME          STATUS   AGE
default       Active   22h
kube-public   Active   22h
kube-system   Active   22h
```

 - Generally, Kubernetes creates two default Namespaces: kube-system and default. 
    - The kube-system Namespace contains the objects created by the Kubernetes system.
    - By default, we connect to the default Namespace.
 - kube-public is a special Namespace, which is readable by all users and used for special purposes, like bootstrapping a cluster. 
 - Using **Resource Quotas**, we can divide the cluster resources within Namespaces. 

# Authentication, Authorization, and Admission Control

## Overview

 - To access and manage any resources/objects in the Kubernetes cluster, we need to access a specific API endpoint on the API server. 
 - Each access request goes through the following three stages:
    - Authentication
        - Logs in a user.
    - Authorization
        - Authorizes the API requests added by the logged-in user.
    - Admission Control
        - Software modules that can modify or reject the requests based on some additional checks, like **Quota**.

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mebusy/notes/master/imgs/k8s_access_the_API.png)


## Authentication

 - Kubernetes does not have an object called user, nor does it store usernames or other related details in its object store.
 - However, even without that, Kubernetes can use usernames for access control and request logging.
 - Kubernetes has two kinds of users:
    - Normal Users
        - They are managed outside of the Kubernetes cluster via independent services like User/Client Certificates, a file listing usernames/passwords, etc.
    - Service Accounts
        - With Service Account users, in-cluster processes communicate with the API server to perform different operations.
        - Most of the Service Account users are created automatically via the API server, but they can also be created manually. 
        - The Service Account users are tied to a given Namespace and mount the respective credentials to communicate with the API server as Secrets.
 - If properly configured, Kubernetes can also support **anonymous requests**, along with requests from Normal Users and Service Accounts.
 - For authentication, Kubernetes uses different authenticator modules:
    - Client Certificates
        - need to reference a file containing one or more certificate authorities by passing the **--client-ca-file=SOMEFILE** option to the API server. 
    - Static Token File
        - pass a file containing pre-defined bearer tokens with the **--token-auth-file=SOMEFILE** option to the API server. 
        - Currently, these tokens would last indefinitely, and they cannot be changed without restarting the API server.
    - Bootstrap Tokens
        - currently in an alpha statu
    - Static Password File
        - It is similar to Static Token File
        - pass a file containing basic authentication details with the **--basic-auth-file=SOMEFILE** option.
    - Service Account Tokens
        - This is an automatically enabled authenticator that uses signed bearer tokens to verify the requests. 
        - These tokens get attached to Pods using the ServiceAccount Admission Controller, which allows in-cluster processes to talk to the API server.
    - OpenID Connect Tokens
        - OpenID Connect helps us connect with OAuth 2 providers, such as Azure Active Directory, Salesforce, Google, etc., to offload the authentication to external services.
    - Webhook Token Authentication
        - With Webhook-based authentication, verification of bearer tokens can be offloaded to a remote service.
    - Keystone Password
        - Keystone authentication can be enabled by passing the **--experimental-keystone-url=<AuthURL> option** to the API server, where AuthURL is the Keystone server endpoint.
    - Authenticating Proxy
        - If we want to program additional authentication logic, we can use an authenticating proxy. 

 - We can enable multiple authenticators,
    - In order to be successful, you should enable at least two methods: the service account tokens authenticator and the user authenticator.

## Authorization

 - After a successful authentication, users can send the API requests to perform different operations.
 - Then, those API requests get authorized by Kubernetes using various authorization modules.
 - Some of the API request attributes that are reviewed by Kubernetes include user, group, extra, Resource or Namespace, to name a few.
    - Next, these attributes are evaluated against policies. 
    - If the evaluation is successful, then the request will be allowed, otherwise it will get denied. 
 - Similar to the Authentication step, Authorization has multiple modules/authorizers.

 - Authorization modules
    - Node Authorizer
        - Node authorization is a special-purpose authorization mode which specifically authorizes API requests made by kubelets.
        - It authorizes the kubelet's read operations for services, endpoints, nodes, etc., and writes operations for nodes, pods, events, etc. 
    - Attribute-Based Access Control (ABAC) Authorizer
        - With the ABAC authorizer, Kubernetes grants access to API requests, which combine policies with  attributes.
        - In the following example, user nkhare can only read Pods in the Namespace lfs158.
        - 
        ```
        {
          "apiVersion": "abac.authorization.kubernetes.io/v1beta1",
          "kind": "Policy",
          "spec": {
            "user": "nkhare",
            "namespace": "lfs158",
            "resource": "pods",
            "readonly": true
          }
        }
        ```

        - To enable the ABAC authorizer, we would need to start the API server with the **--authorization-mode=ABAC** option.
        - We would also need to specify the authorization policy, like **--authorization-policy-file=PolicyFile.json**
    - Webhook Authorizer
        - With the Webhook authorizer, Kubernetes can offer authorization decisions to some third-party services, which would return true for successful authorization, and false for failure. 
        - In order to enable the Webhook authorizer, we need to start the API server with the **--authorization-webhook-config-file=SOME_FILENAME** option, where SOME_FILENAME is the configuration of the remote authorization service. 
    - Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) Authorizer
        - 使用RBAC，我们可以根据各个用户的角色来规范对资源的访问。
        - In Kubernetes, we can have different roles that can be attached to subjects like users, service accounts, etc. 
        - While creating the roles, we restrict resource access by specific operations, such as create, get, update, patch, etc.
        - In RBAC, we can create two kinds of roles:
            - Role  -- With Role, we can grant access to resources within a specific Namespace.
            - ClusterRole  -- The ClusterRole can be used to grant the same permissions as Role does, but its scope is cluster-wide.
        - 
        ```
        kind: Role
        apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
        metadata:
          namespace: lfs158
          name: pod-reader
        rules:
        ~ apiGroups: [""] # "" indicates the core API group, ~ should be -
          resources: ["pods"]
          verbs: ["get", "watch", "list"]
        ```

        - Above example creates a pod-reader role, which has access only to the Pods of lfs158 Namespace.
        - Once the role is created, we can bind users with RoleBinding.
        - There are two kinds of RoleBindings:         
            - RoleBinding
                - It allows us to bind users to the same namespace as a Role 
            - ClusterRoleBinding
                - It allows us to grant access to resources at a cluster-level and to all Namespaces.
        - 
        ```
        kind: RoleBinding
        apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
        metadata:
          name: pod-read-access
          namespace: lfs158
        subjects:
        ~ kind: User  # ~ should be -
          name: nkhare
          apiGroup: rbac.authorization.k8s.io
        roleRef:
          kind: Role
          name: pod-reader
          apiGroup: rbac.authorization.k8s.io
        ```

        - see above example,  it gives access to nkhare to read the Pods of lfs158 Namespace.
        - To enable the RBAC authorizer, we would need to start the API server with the **--authorization-mode=RBAC** option. 
        - With the RBAC authorizer, we dynamically configure policies. 


## Admission Control

 - Admission control is used to specify granular access control policies, which include allowing privileged containers, checking on resource quota, etc.
 - We force these policies using different admission controllers, like ResourceQuota, AlwaysAdmit, DefaultStorageClass, etc. 
 - To use admission controls, we must start the Kubernetes API server with the admission-control

```
--admission-control=NamespaceLifecycle,ResourceQuota,PodSecurityPolicy,DefaultStorageClass.
```

 - By default, Kubernetes comes with some built-in admission controllers.

# Service

## Connecting Users to Pods

 - To access the application, a user/client needs to connect to the Pods
 - Kubernetes provides a higher-level abstraction called Service, which logically groups Pods and a policy to access them. 
    - This grouping is achieved via Labels and Selectors, which we talked about in the previous chapter. 
 - We can assign a name to the logical grouping, referred to as a **Service name**. 

## Service Object Example

 - The following is an example of a Service object:

```
kind: Service
apiVersion: v1
metadata:
  name: frontend-svc
spec:
  selector:
    app: frontend
  ports:
    - protocol: TCP
      port: 80
      targetPort: 5000
```

 - In this example, we are creating a **frontend-svc** Service by selecting all the Pods that have the Label **app** set to the **frontend**.
 - By default, each Service also gets an IP address, which is routable only inside the cluster. 
    - The IP address attached to each Service is also known as the ClusterIP for that Service.
 - The user/client now connects to a service via the IP address, which forwards the traffic to one of the Pods attached to it.
    - A service does the load balancing while selecting the Pods for forwarding the data/traffic.
 - While forwarding the traffic from the Service, we can select the target port on the Pod.
    - for example, for frontend-svc, we will receive requests on Port 80.  We will then forward these requests to one of the attached Pods on Port 5000. 
    - If the target port is not defined explicitly, then traffic will be forwarded to Pods on the port on which the Service receives traffic.

## kube-proxy

 - All of the worker nodes run a daemon called kube-proxy, which watches the API server on the master node for the addition and removal of Services and endpoints. 
 - For each new Service, on each node, kube-proxy configures the iptables rules to capture the traffic for its ClusterIP and forwards it to one of the endpoints.
 - When the service is removed, kube-proxy removes the iptables rules on all nodes as well.

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mebusy/notes/master/imgs/k8s-kube-proxy-svc-endpoint.png)


## Service Discovery

As Services are the primary mode of communication in Kubernetes, we need a way to discover them at runtime. 

Kubernetes supports two methods of discovering a Service:

 - Environment Variables
    - As soon as the Pod starts on any worker node, the kubelet daemon running on that node adds a set of environment variables in the Pod for all active Services.
    - For example, if we have an active Service called redis-master, which exposes port 6379, and its ClusterIP is 172.17.0.6, then, on a newly created Pod, we can see the following environment variables:
    - 
    ```
    REDIS_MASTER_SERVICE_HOST=172.17.0.6
    REDIS_MASTER_SERVICE_PORT=6379
    REDIS_MASTER_PORT=tcp://172.17.0.6:6379
    REDIS_MASTER_PORT_6379_TCP=tcp://172.17.0.6:6379
    REDIS_MASTER_PORT_6379_TCP_PROTO=tcp
    REDIS_MASTER_PORT_6379_TCP_PORT=6379
    REDIS_MASTER_PORT_6379_TCP_ADDR=172.17.0.6
    ```

 - DNS
    - Kubernetes has an add-on for DNS, which creates a DNS record for each Service and its format is like my-svc.my-namespace.svc.cluster.local
    - **Services within the same Namespace can reach to other Services with just their name.**
    - For example, if we add a Service redis-master in the **my-ns** Namespace, then all the Pods in the same Namespace can reach to the redis Service just by using its name, **redis-master**. 
    - Pods from other Namespaces can reach the Service by adding the respective Namespace as a `suffix`, like **redis-master.my-ns**. 
    - This is the most common and highly recommended solution. 

        
## ServiceType

 - While defining a Service, we can also choose its access scope.
 - We can decide whether the Service:
    - Is only accessible within the cluster
    - Is accessible from within the cluster and the external world
    - Maps to an external entity which resides outside the cluster.
 - Access scope is decided by `ServiceType`, which can be mentioned when creating the Service.

### ServiceType: ClusterIP and NodePort

 - ClusterIP is the default ServiceType. 
    - A Service gets its Virtual IP address using the ClusterIP. 
    - That IP address is used for communicating with the Service and is accessible only within the cluster. 
 - With the NodePort ServiceType, in addition to creating a ClusterIP, a port from the range 30000-32767 is mapped to the respective Service, from all the worker nodes.
    - For example, if the mapped NodePort is `32233` for the service frontend-svc, then, if we connect to any worker node on port 32233, the node would redirect all the traffic to the assigned ClusterIP - 172.17.0.4.

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mebusy/notes/master/imgs/k8s-NodePort.png)

 - The NodePort ServiceType is useful when we want to make our Services accessible from the external world.
 - The end-user connects to the worker nodes on the specified port, which forwards the traffic to the applications running inside the cluster.
 - To access the application from the external world, administrators can configure a reverse proxy outside the Kubernetes cluster and map the specific endpoint to the respective port on the worker nodes. 


### ServiceType: LoadBalancer

 - With the LoadBalancer ServiceType:
    - NodePort and ClusterIP Services are automatically created, and the external load balancer will route to them
    - The Services are exposed at a static port on each worker node
    - The Service is exposed externally using the underlying cloud provider's load balancer feature.
